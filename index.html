    <h1>Some Golden Words</h1>
    <p>We are going to talk about some programming things. <br/><strong>Beware:</strong> The lazy people wont work hard and they will stop you too so <em>get</em> rid of them <abbr title="As Soos As Possible">ASAP</abbr>.
        There is nothing free in this world, as there is saying:<q>Knowledge is not free, you have to <strong>Pay attention.</strong></q></p>
        <p>Stephen Hawking Says:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://teambuilding.com/blog/success-quotes">However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.</blockquote>

            Mike, the Rich dad of Robert T. Kiyosaki Says as in the Book <cite>Rich Dad Poor Dad</cite>: <br/>
            <blockquote>
                Most people have a price. And they have a price because of
                human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to
                work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the
                wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set

    <h2>1. Web Develompent</h2>
    <p>This can be done with various ways</p>
    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>
      What is coding? <dfn>Coding</dfn>, sometimes called computer programming, is how we
      communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take,
      and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to
      write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much
      faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process
      data, and do lots of other cool things.

    <h4>HTML</h4>
    <p>
      It's 9<sup>th</sup> of July 2023. and i would have to say that HTML stands
      for
      <q
        ><b><i>Hyper-Text Markup Language.</i></b></q
      >
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript.

    <h3>Word-Press</h3>
    <p>
      WordPress is a web content management system. It was originally created as
      a tool to publish blogs but has evolved to support publishing other web
      content, including more traditional websites, mailing lists and Internet
      forum, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems and
      online stores.

    <h2>2. Desktop App Develompent</h2>
    <p>
      Desktop applications are programs designed to run on computers and use
      system resources to perform their functions. These programs run on top of
      operating systems such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Some top
      examples of desktop applications include Microsoft Office, VLC Media
      Player, Windows File Explorer, and Activity Monitor on macOS. Accessing
      and using a desktop application is a straightforward process. Apart from
      those preinstalled on your computer, you first have to download the
      software from an official website. For instance, if you want to use
      Microsoft Excel, you'll have to look for Microsoft Office on Microsoft
      official website. From there, you can download the software to your
      computer and install it. After installation, you can search for the
      installed version of the app on your computer and launch it. Most desktop
      applications usually include icons on the desktop window for easier
      accessibility. Desktop programs also store user data locally, which allows
      you to access numerous functionalities without having a network
      connection.
